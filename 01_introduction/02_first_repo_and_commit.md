# Creating and Using a Git Repository (Inception Edition)

This guide walks you through creating a Git repository, cloning it locally, adding a project structure inspired by the movie Inception, and pushing your first commit to GitHub.

## 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in.
2. Click the **"+"** icon in the top right corner and select **"New repository"**.
3. Give your repository a name, e.g., `inception-project-files`.
4. (Optional) Add a description: `Dream layers, plans, and totems from Cobb's crew.`
5. Choose public or private depending on your preference.
6. **Do not** initialize with a README (we'll do it manually).
7. Click **"Create repository"**.

## 2. Clone the Repository Locally

Open **Git Bash** or your terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/inception-project-files.git
cd inception-project-files
```

Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

## 3. Create Folders and Files

Let’s simulate a structure inspired by dream infiltration:

```bash
mkdir -p dreams/layer1
mkdir -p dreams/layer2
mkdir -p dreams/layer3
mkdir -p characters/ariadne
mkdir -p totems/cobb

touch README.md
echo "# Inception Mission Files" > README.md

echo "Layer 1: The city dream. Status: stable." > dreams/layer1/status.txt
echo "Layer 2: Hotel physics altered. Gravity disabled." > dreams/layer2/log.txt
echo "Layer 3: Snow fortress infiltration ongoing." > dreams/layer3/notes.txt
echo "Ariadne's sketchbook: Designing paradox stairs." > characters/ariadne/plans.txt
echo "Cobb's totem: Still spinning..." > totems/cobb/totem.txt
```

## 4. Stage and Commit the Files

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with Inception-themed structure and dream logs"
```

## 5. Push to GitHub

```bash
git push origin main
```

If your repo uses `master` instead of `main`, replace accordingly.

🎉 **You're done!** You’ve just created a dream within a repo within a push.
